Whew! Just walked out of Chasing the Wind and let me tell you, my ears are still ringing with the noise of explosions and those weird shifty whispers, you know? the theater was filled with that stale popcorn smell — crumbs all over my shirt, and my back is killing me from those seats. But wow, what a whirlwind of a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮. Felt like being pulled through a wormhole made of cotton candy and cold spaghetti.

The opening scene—oh boy, with the protagonist chasing that giant wind turbine like it was the meaning of life or maybe just his lost socks, and it made me think of that time I ran after the ice cream truck barefoot... barefoot... the music, so haunting, kept creeping back like an echo of my thoughts.

> Heh, there was this bit near the end where the hero just stands in the middle of a storm, screaming like a banshee — reminded me of my neighbor last week when her allergies acted up. Irony? Maybe. Stunning visual, albeit confusing. His coat flapping like a flag at half-mast. Get it? Half-mast... haha, oh whatever.

Did I mention the scene with the girl at the flower shop? More like emo garden of metaphors. Claustrophobic yet expansive. She talks to petals like they’ve got souls. Almost cried but remembered someone telling me “𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ” later — maybe I should re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the whole thing in a clearer mind? The dust in this theater... yikes.

Ooh and when the antagonist (the smarmy guy, remember him? always squinting like he’s got a splinter in his eye) finally reveals his master plan, I almost choked on my popcorn. No one saw that coming — not even the ushers. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , they said. Seriously though, the plot was twistier than my old earphones.

Lost my train of thought, like a tumbleweed in the mind desert. Something about the cinematography being reminiscent of that dream where everything’s in sepia and you can’t find your pants... yeah, that’s it. Saw my reflection in the lobby mirror afterward, mascara smudged like war paint. Thought the   really spoke to me, or at least muttered incoherently in my direction.

Random thoughts. But like, can I even convey what Chasing the Wind did to my brain? Beyond words, it scattered them like confetti. Told Bill about this one line from the flick where they’re talking about fate being like a cataclysmic dance — feels deep, but also senseless in retrospect. No regerts.

function misunderstandReality() {
  var chaos = infinite;
  while (true) {
    dreams = chaseWind();
    if (dreams == chaos) break;
  }
}

Ah, ignore the code... Mistakenly from another screen or dimension, I suppose.
